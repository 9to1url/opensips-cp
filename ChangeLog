	* [c3ac573] :

	Automatically print only error from the MI level, and skip errors from cmd level.

2019-04-01  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [74b3b87] :

	Get rid of unix_timestamp()
	Makes no sense to test by converting both input and DB value to timestamp (from datatime) as the convertion is done by DB server (so, with the same TZ).
	And using the unix_timestamp() in the query breaks the indexing and makes the queries realy slow.
